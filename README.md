Disclaimer: This is a thought experiment and is for educational purposes. The author takes no responsibility for the misuse of these scripts.

Dependencies:
* No dependencies (requests and sqlite3 are currently part of Python 3.8 standard library)

Steps:
* Run setup_thingiverse_database.py to create database for storage
* Define configuration variables at the top of thingiverse_scraper.py
* Run thingiverse_scraper.py and get a coffee (This will take a real long time...)
